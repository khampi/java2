Sheela has three things in her bag. She wants to compute the area of 3 things but 3 things are in different shapes. The three things are in square shape, rectangular shape, and circular shape respectively. Write a program to help Sheela to calculate the area of different shapes. 

Input format: 

First input: a side of a square in integer 

Second input: length of a rectangle in integer 

Third input: breadth of a rectangle in integer 

Fourth input: radius of a circle in float 

Output format: 

The first output should be the area of a square in integer 

The second output should be the area of a rectangle in integer 

The third output should be the area of a circle in float with 2 decimal places
